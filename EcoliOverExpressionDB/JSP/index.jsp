                                                             Recombinant protein production is a significant biotechnological process, because it allows
                                                             researchers to produce a specific protein in desired quantities. <i>Escherichia coli</i>

                                                             is the most popular heterologous expression host for the production of recombinant proteins
                                                             due to its advantages such as low cost, high-productivity, well-characterized genetics, simple
                                                             growth requirements, rapid growth, easy induction with isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)
                                                             and quite simple purification.

                                                             There are a number of factors that influence the expression level of a recombinant protein in
